# Access & Download HuBMAP Data

## How can I Access and Download Data?

Access to most* <i>published</i> data on <a href="https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/">HuBMAP's Data Portal</a> is open to all interested viewers. <br />
You can search for these datasets, view them, and download them, without additional barriers (account creation, login, etc.).
- Find data using faceted search - <a href="https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/search?entity_type[0]=Dataset">Explore datasets</a>.
- <a href="https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/cells">Explore by biological entities</a> (organs, molecules, or cell types).
- Preview and <a href="https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/search?entity_type[0]=Dataset">Download datasets</a> via Globus.
  - All options (above) include built-in tutorials.
- <a href="https://docs.hubmapconsortium.org/clt/index.html">Using the HuBMAP CLT</a> - [Command Line Transfer] tool to download a Manifest file (individual files and directories across multiple datasets) in a single file.

<b>*Note:</b> An <i>exception</i> to this is raw genetic data. Downloading this type of HuBMAP data requires NIH approval.

## Sequencing (Raw Genetic) vs. Other Datasets
- When you browse HuBMAP datasets that contain sequencing data, you won't be able to download those (directly) from the HuBMAP Data Portal.
- When you browse other datasets on the Portal, you will see a link to download those published datasets.
  - HuBMAP requires that sequencing (raw genetic) data be submitted to NIH's dbGaP.
  - Go to <a href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">dbGaP's Data Download</a> management portal to learn...
