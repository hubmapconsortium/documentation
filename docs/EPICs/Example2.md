## EPIC Example Type 2
### Object by Analyte: <mark>Draft</mark>

<mark>This specification is undergoing final testing, using example datasets.</mark>
Object x analyte are data matrices containing the measured analyte levels for a set of analytes across a set of objects such as cells or nuclei (see Fig 3). For example, this could be a matrix of barcoded cells x gene expression values or a matrix of barcoded cells x metabolite levels. The values included might be raw computed gene expression values or normalized values, spanning multiple datasets. Alternatively, an object x analyte dataset could simply denote a novel set of annotations for an existing analysis. In this case, it would _not_ include the main data matrix.
