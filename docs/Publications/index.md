# Publication Page Upload Workflow
## Introduction
_What is the purpose of publication pages?_<br>
The purpose of [publication pages](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/publications) in the HuBMAP Data Portal is to:
- provide an overview of and showcase HuBMAP publications
- make it easy for members of the community to find datasets, samples, and donors included in HuBMAP publications
- feature exciting data through interactive [Vitessce-based visualizations](https://vitessce.io) in ways not possible in PDF-based publications
  
_Who can contribute to a publication page?_ <br>
- **Any HuBMAP member can submit a publication page for any of their publications that use publicly available data in the HuBMAP Data Portal.**
- Both preprints and published papers can be shared as publication pages.
- **Note:** The HuBMAP HIVE will _not_ be responsible for the creation of publication pages or maintenance of their content beyond regular HuBMAP Data Portal maintenance. 

_What is the process of submitting a publication page?_ <br>
To re-use existing HuBMAP infrastructure and processes, publication pages use a process that is almost identical to regular dataset submissions, see details below. Like datasets, a publication page (or “publication dataset”) can be updated at any time by the authors. Initially, publication pages will be in “QA” status and only accessible to consortium members until they have been reviewed by the authors, at which point the HuBMAP HIVE curation team will switch the status to “Published”. 

## Prerequisites
1. The Globus organization associated with your Globus user account must be a “Data Provider” group. If you previously submitted data to the HuBMAP Data Portal, that will be the case. If not, please contact the [HuBMAP Helpdesk](mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org). 
2. Your data needs to be prepared according to the instructions included in the “Upload Files” section of this document. The process of preparing the data for a publication page is the same as preparing any other dataset for upload to the portal. The “assay type” in this case is “publication”. See the [metadata and directory schemas](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/publication/) for a publication.
