Spatial profiling experiments target specific tissue foci but do not necessarily generate images. Spatial imaging expriments collect data from a regular array (pixels) that can be visualized as heat maps of ion intensity at each location (molecular images). Leave blank if data are derived from bulk analysis.                                                                                                                                                                             |         | False      |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list.
