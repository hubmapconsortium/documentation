| barcode_offset                                      | Barcode offset                                      | ENUM      | Positions in the read at which the cell or capture spot barcodes start. Cell and capture spot barcodes are, for example, 3 x 8 bp sequences that are spaced by constant sequences (the offsets). First barcode at position 0, then 38, then 76. This should be included when constructing sequencing libraries with a non-commercial kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ENUM    | True       |
