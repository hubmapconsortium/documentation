| Lab ID                                              | textfield | An internal field labs can use it to add whatever ID(s) they want or need for dataset validation and tracking.

| Preparation protocol DOI                            | link      | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurment and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might include staining of a section through the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file. Example: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyno9qvx9/v1                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                | True       |

The CODEX analyte is protein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0,1                                                            | True       |
| Parent sample ID                                    | textfield | Unique HuBMAP or SenNet identifier of the sample (i.e., block, section or suspension) used to perform this assay. For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                       |                                                                | True       |
| Barcode offset                                      | radio     | Positions in the read at which the cell or capture spot barcodes start. Cell and capture spot barcodes are, for example, 3 x 8 bp sequences that are spaced by constant sequences (the offsets). First barcode at position 0, then 38, then 76. This should be included when constructing sequencing libraries with a non-commercial kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0,1,2,3,4,5                                                    | True       |
