| Data path                                           | textfield | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest.                                                                                                                            |                                                                | True       |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                | True       |

For CosMx, Xenium and Resolve, this is the area of the FOV (aka ROI) region being captured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                | False      |

| Non global files                                    | textfield | A semicolon separated list of non-shared files to be included in the dataset. The path assumes the files are located in the "TOP/non-global/" directory. For example, for the file is TOP/non-global/lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson the value of this field would be "./lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson". After ingest, these files will be copied to the appropriate locations within the respective dataset directory tree. This field is used for internal HuBMAP processing. Examples for GeoMx and PhenoCycler are provided in the File Locations documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2McSs9geA9Eli4QWQaB3c9R3wo5d5U1Xd57DWQfN5Q/edit#heading=h.1u82i4axggee |                                                                | False      |
