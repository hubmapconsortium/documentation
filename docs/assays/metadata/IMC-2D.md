| Lab ID                                              | textfield | An internal field labs can use it to add whatever ID(s) they want or need for dataset validation and tracking. This could be a single ID (e.g., "Visium_9OLC_A4_S1") or a delimited list of IDs (e.g., “9OL; 9OLC.A2; Visium_9OLC_A4_S1”). This field will not be accessible to anyone outside of the consortium and no effort will be made to check if IDs provided by one data provider are also used by another.                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                | False      |

| Acquisition instrument model                        | ENUM      | Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Values](https://purl.humanatlas.io/vocab/hravs#HRAVS_1000401) | True       |
| Source storage duration value                       | numeric   | How long was the source material stored, prior to this sample being processed? For assays applied to tissue sections, this would be how long the tissue section (e.g., slide) was stored, prior to the assay beginning (e.g., imaging). For assays applied to suspensions such as sequencing, this would be how long the suspension was stored before library construction began.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                | True       |

| Data path                                           | textfield | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |                                                                | True       |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                       |                                                                | True       |
