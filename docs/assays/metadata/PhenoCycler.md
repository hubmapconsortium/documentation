This path should begin with "." and would likely be something like "./extras/antibodies.tsv".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                | True       |
| Parent sample ID                                    | textfield | Unique HuBMAP or SenNet identifier of the sample (i.e., block, section or suspension) used to perform this assay. For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                | True       |
| Nuclear marker or stain                             | radio     | For markers, an antibody-targetted molecule present in or around the cell nucleus, the protein or gene symbol that identifies the antibody target that is used as the nuclear marker. This symbol must match the antibody target that is either generated from the panel used or entered with custom panels. Preferably, if using a custom antibody marker, this symbol should be the HGNC symbol (https://www.genenames.org/).   For non-protein targets this is the stain name (e.g., DAPI) and, when appropriate, associated staining kit and vendor. For the PhenoCycler, this symbol must match the value found in the XPD output file.                                                                     | 0,1                                                            | True       |
| Cell boundary marker or stain                       | radio     | If a marker or stain was used to identify all cell boundaries in the tissue, then the name of the marker or stain should be included here. The name of the antibody-targeted molecule marker or non-antibody targeted molecule stain included here must be identical to what is found in the imaging data. For example, with the PhenoCycler, this name must match the value found in the XPD output file. If multiple marker or stains are used to identify all cell boundaries, then a comma separated list should be used here.                                                                                                                                                                               | 0,1,2                                                          | True       |
| Non global files                                    | textfield | A semicolon separated list of non-shared files to be included in the dataset. The path assumes the files are located in the "TOP/non-global/" directory. For example, for the file is TOP/non-global/lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson the value of this field would be "./lab_processed/images/1-tissue-boundary.geojson". After ingest, these files will be copied to the appropriate locations within the respective dataset directory tree. This field is used for internal HuBMAP processing. Examples for GeoMx and PhenoCycler are provided in the File Locations documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2McSs9geA9Eli4QWQaB3c9R3wo5d5U1Xd57DWQfN5Q/edit#heading=h.1u82i4axggee |                                                                | False      |
