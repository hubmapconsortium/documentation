## Version 2 (current)

| Attribute Name | Type | Description | Allowable Values | Required |
|---------------|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Lab ID | Textfield | An internal field labs can use it to add whatever ID(s) they want or need for dataset validation and tracking. This could be a single ID (e.g., "Visium_9OLC_A4_S1") or a delimited list of IDs (e.g., “9OL; 9OLC.A2; Visium_9OLC_A4_S1”). This field will not be accessible to anyone outside of the consortium and no effort will be made to check if IDs provided by one data provider are also used by another. |  | False |
| Source storage duration value | Numeric | How long was the source material (parent) stored, prior to this sample being processed. |  | True |
| Time since acquisition instrument calibration value | Numeric | The amount of time since the acquisition instrument was last serviced or calibrated. This provides a metric for assessing drift in data capture. |  | False |
| Contributors path | Textfield | The path to the file with the ORCID IDs for all contributors of this dataset (e.g., "extras/contributors.tsv" or "./contributors.tsv"). This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |  | True |
| Data path | Textfield | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "/TEST001-RK/" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "/TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |  | True |
| Number of antibodies | Numeric | Number of antibodies |  | True |
| Number of biomarker imaging rounds | Numeric | Number of imaging rounds to capture the tagged biomarkers. For CODEX a biomarker imaging round consists of 1. oligo and fluor application, 2. imaging, 3. removal of oligo and fluor along washes. For Cell DIVE a biomarker imaging round consists of 1. staining of a biomarker via secondary detection or direct conjugate and 2. dye inactivation. |  | True |
| Number of total imaging rounds | Numeric | The total number of acquisitions performed on microscope to collect autofluorescence/background or stained signal (e.g., histology). |  | True |
| Slide ID | Textfield | A unique ID denoting the slide used. This allows users the ability to determine which tissue sections were processed together on the same slide. It is recommended that data providers prefix the ID with the center name, to prevent values overlapping across centers. |  | True |

| Preparation protocol DOI | Link | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurement and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might begin with staining of a section and finalize with the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file. Example: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyno9qvx9/v1. |  | True |
| Is targeted? | Radio | Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay ("Yes" or "No"). The CODEX analyte is protein. | ```Yes```, ```No``` | True |
| Antibodies path | Textfield | This is the location of the antibodies.tsv file relative to the root of the top level of the upload directory structure. This path should begin with "." and would likely be something like "./extras/antibodies.tsv". |  | True |
| Parent sample ID | Textfield | Unique HuBMAP or SenNet identifier of the sample (i.e., block, section or suspension) used to perform this assay.
