This could be a single ID (e.g., "Visium_9OLC_A4_S1") or a delimited list of IDs (e.g., “9OL; 9OLC.A2; Visium_9OLC_A4_S1”). This field will not be accessible to anyone outside of the consortium and no effort will be made to check if IDs provided by one data provider are also used by another.                                                                                                                                                                   |         | False      |

Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         | True       |

For assays applied to tissue sections, this would be how long the tissue section (e.g., slide) was stored, prior to the assay beginning (e.g., imaging). For assays applied to suspensions such as sequencing, this would be how long the suspension was stored before library construction began.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         | True       |

For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might include staining of a section through the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file. Example: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyno9qvx9/v1                                                                                                                                                                                  |         | True       |

For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |         | True       |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102                                                                                                                                       |         | True       |

For GeoMx this would be the area of the AOI being captured. For HiFi this is the summed area of the ROIs in a single flowcell lane. For CosMx, Xenium and Resolve, this is the area of the FOV (aka ROI) region being captured.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         | True       |
