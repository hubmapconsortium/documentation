| lab_id                                              | Textfield      | An internal field labs can use this attribute to add whatever ID(s) they want or need for dataset validation and tracking. This could be a single ID (e.g., "Visium_9OLC_A4_S1") or a delimited list of IDs (e.g., “9OL; 9OLC.A2; Visium_9OLC_A4_S1”). This field will not be accessible to anyone outside of the consortium and no effort will be made to check if IDs provided by one data provider are also used by another.                                                                                                                                                                   |                | False    |

| preparation_protocol_doi                            | Textfield          | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurement and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might begin with staining of a section and finalize with the creation of an OME-TIFF file.

For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest. |                | True     |

For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list.
