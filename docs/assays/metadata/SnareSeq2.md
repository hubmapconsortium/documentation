# SnareSeq2

## Current Metadata Attributes
| Attribute | Type      | Description              | Allowable Values |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
|Parent sample ID | type | Unique HuBMAP or SenNet identifier of the sample (i.e., block, section or suspension) used to perform this assay. For example, for a RNAseq assay, the parent would be the suspension, whereas, for one of the imaging assays, the parent would be the tissue section. If an assay comes from multiple parent samples then this should be a comma separated list. Example: HBM386.ZGKG.235, HBM672.MKPK.442 or SNT232.UBHJ.322, SNT329.ALSK.102| value |
|Lab ID | type | An internal field labs can use it to add whatever ID(s) they want or need for dataset validation and tracking. This could be a single ID (e.g., "Visium_9OLC_A4_S1") or a delimited list of IDs (e.g., “9OL; 9OLC.A2; Visium_9OLC_A4_S1”). This field will not be accessible to anyone outside of the consortium and no effort will be made to check if IDs provided by one data provider are also used by another.| value |
|Preparation protocol DOI | type | DOI for the protocols.io page that describes the assay or sample procurment and preparation. For example for an imaging assay, the protocol might include staining of a section through the creation of an OME-TIFF file. In this case the protocol would include any image processing steps required to create the OME-TIFF file. Example: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2lyno9qvx9/v1| value |
|Dataset type | type | The specific type of dataset being produced.| value |
|Contributors path | type | The path to the file with the ORCID IDs for all contributors of this dataset (e.g., "./extras/contributors.tsv" or "./contributors.tsv"). This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest.| value |
|Data path | type | The top level directory containing the raw and/or processed data. For a single dataset upload this might be "." where as for a data upload containing multiple datasets, this would be the directory name for the respective dataset. For instance, if the data is within a directory called "TEST001-RK" use syntax "./TEST001-RK" for this field. If there are multiple directory levels, use the format "./TEST001-RK/Run1/Pass2" in which "Pass2" is the subdirectory where the single dataset's data is stored. This is an internal metadata field that is just used for ingest.| value |
|Number of pre-amplification PCR cycles | type | The number of PCR cycles run after the Chromium Controller step and prior to separating the suspension and initiating library construction| value |
|Metadata schema ID | type | The string that serves as the definitive identifier for the metadata schema version and is readily interpretable by computers for data validation and processing. Example: 22bc762a-5020-419d-b170-24253ed9e8d9 | value |
