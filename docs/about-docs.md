# HuBMAP - The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program 

HuBMAP is working to catalyze the development of a framework for mapping the human body at single cell resolution. 
We are developing the tools to create an open, global atlas of the human body at the cellular level. These tools and maps are openly available, to accelerate understanding of the relationships between cell and tissue organization and function and human health.

It takes trillions of cells to build a human adult, and how those cells interact, connect, and arrange into tissues has a direct effect on our health. HuBMAP is creating the next generation of molecular analysis technologies and computational tools, enabling the generation of foundational 3D tissue maps and construction of an atlas of the function and relationships among cells in the human body. These maps and atlas can lead us to a better understanding of how the relationships among our cells affects our health.

HuBMAP is a consortium composed of diverse research teams funded by the Common Fund at the National Institutes of Health. HuBMAP values secure, open sharing, and collaboration with other consortia and the wider research community.

This site documents for internal and external stakeholders ways to interact with HuBMAP's data and tools.

[Image of the Week Gallery](https://hubmapconsortium.org/image-of-the-week/) - Every week we feature an image from one of HuBMAP's funded research groups.

[HuBMAP Data Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/) - An open platform to discover, visualize, and download healthy single-cell tissue data.

[HuBMAP Funded Research](https://hubmapconsortium.org/group-pages-index/) - These funded groups that carry out the work of HuBMAP make up the HuBMAP Consortium.
