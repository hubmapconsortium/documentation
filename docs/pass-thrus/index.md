# Pass Through Dataset Types

## What are they? 
"Pass Throughs" are Dataset Types/Assays that are not yet widely adopted within biomedical research. These may include newly available industry assays or new assays developed by consortia TDAs for which a lab wishes to publish data, often to support a publication.

Given their lack of widespread adoption, the decision was made that the consortia would publish these datasets with a streamlined set of metadata and simplified directory structures, thereby simplifying the publishing process. 

**Note:** Unlike most other dataset types, _Pass Throughs_ are _not_ processed by the HIVE (HuBMAP) or CODCC (SenNet) prior to publication.  

## Current examples
- DBiT-seq
  - See example [_metadata_ and _directory schemas_](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/dbit-seq/current/) for this _Pass Through_ dataset type
- Stereo-seq 
- Singular Genomics G4X

### Publishing a Pass Through Dataset Type
If you have data that may be appropriate for publishing as a _Pass Through_, please contact the appropriate Help Desk and provide the following information:
- Assay Name
- Assay Type (e.g., Spatial Transcriptomics)
- Existing [assay metadata schema](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/current) that most closely mirrors your assay
- Anticipated number of datasets to be published
- Needed to support publication? (Y/N)
- TMC/TDA Name
- Contact person and email
