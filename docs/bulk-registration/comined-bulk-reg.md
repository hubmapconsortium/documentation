# Combined Bulk Registration

To bulk register donors and samples at the same time, log into the [Data Ingest Portal](https://ingest.hubmapconsortium.org) and use the "Donors + Samples" menu pick under the "Bulk" menu.

On the combined bulk registration page you'll be asked to upload a .tsv file containing one row for each donor and sample that will be registered.  An [example combined.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-ui/master/src/src/assets/Documents/example-combined-registrations.tsv) file is provided as a template. This .tsv file contains 11 columns (fields) that contain required information for each donor and sample to be registered.  A description of these fields is below.  Once the .tsv file has been successfully uploaded and submitted the system will register the donors and samples provide the new HuBMAP IDs for these entities.

| rui_location       | This field is requred for all block level registrations.  This is the JSON output from the [location Registrion User Interface Tool (RUI)](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-ui/rui/), spatially locating the block inside the organ of origin.  See the [RUI Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=142hGer4xvU) for instruction on how to register a location and obtain the JSON representation.  |
   

### Donor metadata submission
After donors have been registered documents need to be provided to the HIVE so additional "Donor Metadata" can be extracted.  See a description on the [Donor MetadataPage](https://software.docs.hubmapconsortium.org/donor.html)

### Sample Metadata Submission
After samples have been registered sample metadata must be provided to the HuBMAP data curators.  Please contact help@hubmapconsortium.org to initiate this process.  See a description on the sample metadata, submitted as .tsv files on the  [Sample Metadata TSV Page](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/sample/).
