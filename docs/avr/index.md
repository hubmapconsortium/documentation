# Antibody Validation Report Repository

The Antibody Validation Report Repository is a searchable repository of antibody validation reports (AVRs) used within the HuBMAP Consortium during the execution of the various assays performed to generate data.

To upload reports to the system you must be a member of the HuBMAP Consortium with write access for any given data provider group.  If you are a Consortium member without access you can request access by sending a message to <help@hubmapconsortium.org> requesting to be added to your Consortium Component's Globus group.

See the [AVR FAQ](/avr/avr-faq.html) page for answers to general questions about the HuBMAP Antibody Validation Reports.

The attributes collected describing the AVRs are described in the [AVR Structure Document](/avr/tsv-format-v2.html)

To upload antibody validation reports see the [AVR Upload Documentation](/avr/avr-upload-v2.html).
