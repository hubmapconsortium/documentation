# HuBMAP Antibody Validation Report CSV Structure
With each submission of AVR documents associated header/metadata information must be include for each AVR document. This information is provided as a .csv file.  It is recommended to start with the blank (header only) [template csv file](/avr/avr-template.csv), use Excel or other spreadsheet to enter the data, then export as a comma separated value (csv) file.  An example [example AVR csv file](/avr/example-avrs.csv) is also available. All columns in the csv file are required, with the definitons of the columns here:


| csv column               | description                                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| protocols_io_doi         | All validation pipelines need an accompanying protocol on protocols.io. If the validation procedure is the same for all antibodies your which lab tests, then a single protocol can be used. If validation procedures differ, then different methods will need different validation protocols. |
| uniprot_accession_number | This can typically be found on the vendorâ€™s website, but can also be found by searching <UniProt.org> directly. Please note that different species have different UniProt accession numbers for the same protein. If your data was acquired using human tissue, be sure you are choosing the UniProt accession for the human protein. |
