# Acknowledgment of Manufacturers in Compliance with NBO-Q
The examples below refer to the _Akoya Biosciences PhenoImager_ but could be applied to more vendors as they also step up to collaborate with this initiative.

Please feel free to comment and suggest edits.

### Text for use with Assay Descriptions using Compliant Instruments

“Thanks to the essential cooperation of _Akoya Biosciences_ and the use of the _Micro-Meta App_ [Rigano et al. 2021](https://paperpile.com/c/FuAhz6/ZNm5), the microscope hardware metadata JSON file associated with this dataset complies with Tier 2 of the NBO-Q Microscope Metadata specifications [Hammer et al. 2021](https://paperpile.com/c/FuAhz6/5Gur). These specifications were developed by the NIH 4D Nucleome (4DN) consortium and BioImaging North America ([BINA](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/)) and were endorsed by QUAREP-LiMi [Boehm et al. 2021](https://paperpile.com/c/FuAhz6/bBND) to extend the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) data-model [Goldberg et al. 2005](https://paperpile.com/c/FuAhz6/vBXs).”

### Text for Social Media

“Thanks to the collaboration with _Akoya Biosciences_ and the use of the [_Micro-Meta App_](https://wu-bimac.github.io/MicroMetaApp.github.io/) @StrambioLab, the hardware specifications associated with multiple publicly available HuBMAP microscopy datasets are now compliant with the NBO-Q specifications [Hammer et al. 2021](https://paperpile.com/c/FuAhz6/5Gur) @bioimagingna @openmicroscopy @quareplimi @4DN. This effort is critical to ensure rigor, reproducibility, and data reuse for multiple publicly available HuBMAP microscopy datasets.”
